Welcome to the ATM Simulation System This is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) based project developed using Java. The system provides an easy-to-use menu for performing essential banking operations such as withdrawals, deposits and balance checks.

## Introduction

Thanks for visiting the ATM Simulation System  
This CLI-based project offers a clear and simple way to execute withdrawals, deposits, and check balances. Built using Java, the system is ideal for beginners and those wanting to understand how control structures like switch-case can be used in Java applications. The system updates the current balance after each operation.

## Explanation

The ATM Simulation System uses a basic command-line interface that allows users to:

- **Deposit** money
- **Withdraw** money
- **Check account balance**

All options are handled using a **switch-case** control structure. After every transaction, the system dynamically updates the user's balance.

## Features

- Easy-to-use CLI interface
- Perform Deposits
- Withdraw funds
- Check current balance
- Input validation
- Updates balance in real-time after each action

## Technologies Used
